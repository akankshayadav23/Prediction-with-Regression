# Advance-Project 1

# Salary Hike Prediction Model

# Objective of Model

 The objective of this project is to build a prediction model for Salary Hike. Leveraging the information about years of experience, we aim to predict the expected salary hike for individuals. 



# Dataset
  Name: Salary Dataset
  
  Columns:Year of Experience. 
         :Salary

#### Model-Used : Linear Regression

# Methodology

### 1.Requirements
    python
    Numpy
    Pandas
    Scikit-learn
    Matplotlib
### 2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Explored the distribution and relationships between the variables.

Investigated the correlation between Years of Experience and Salary.

### 3.Data Preprocessing:

Checked for missing values and outliers.

Ensured proper encoding of categorical variables if any.

### 4.Model Selection:

Chose Linear Regression as the model for predicting Salary Hike based on Years of Experience.

### 5.Model Training and Validation:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Trained the Linear Regression model on the training set.
Validated the model's performance on the testing set.

### 6.Evaluation Metrics:

Utilized metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to assess the accuracy of the Linear Regression model.

### Model Information
